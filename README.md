# Todo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.9.
The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how to work with angular 6. You can run this project as instructions given below. Or you can serve this app with a simple flask program.

This app stores your todo task and display in list for you. Right now there is no server side code associated with it.
We'll build that in next scrums. Right now it's just client side storing.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
